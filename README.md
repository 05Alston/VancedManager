# Vanced Manager
Hi, when we released Vanced 15.05.54, people were upset because it used .apks format, which was way harder to install than a traditional .apk file. even tho we wrote clear instructions on how to install new Vanced, people still couldn't figure it out.  
Then we thought, why don't we make a manager for vanced, which will download, update and uninstall Vanced and MicroG, have an easy and understandable UI and be less than 5mb. that's how Vanced Manager was born.  
  
After 3 months of making, we are finally ready to introduce Vanced Manager to you. Vanced manager can easily install and unintsall vanced and microg, has various settings for customisation and better experience. Manager comes with easy-to-use interface, support for background download and instalation*  
##### *Due to changes in Android Oreo and up, also because of aggressive battery optimisations in some ROMs, feature may not be available for all devices.
