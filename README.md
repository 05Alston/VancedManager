# Prelude
Hi, my name is Steve Cock, I'm the main UI designer for the upcoming Vanced Manager. When xfileFIN first published Vanced 15.05.54, people were upset because new Vanced used split apk files. The reason for that was pretty simple:  
1) YouTube itself does that  
2) Split apk files reduce the size of the downloaded file itself  
No one really thought there would be problems with this format, because installation was pretty simple, at least that's what xfile thought...  
## Problems with .apks format
Main problems with new format were either with device CPU architecture or MemeUI shit with MiUI optimisations. We wrote instructions for VancedHelper but no one used it for troubleshooting. Then some users complained about new format and refused to upgrade to newest version (We don't give a fuck about that) because "I dOn'T WaNT To HaVe OnE MoRE apP To insTalL VanCeD" so we decided to make an installer for vanced  
# Vanced Manager
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very proud to introduce the new **Vanced Manager ci Alpha Ui Preview Test Build 0.1.9â„¢** which doesn't fucking work at the tme because of shit material UI problems and i have no idea ho-  
So... Vanced Manager is an universal utility for installing/updating Vanced and MicroG. It will push notifications once the update is readya and for root users, it can also automatically download and install them (Now that's pwetty epic).  
Vanced manager comes with a slick UI ~~that was stolen from the new Magisk Manager (I'm very sorry john but i looked your code for about 100 times).~~ Actually, while UI may look very similar to new Magisk Manager's UI, It's still very different (that's a blatant lie, I know).  
##### I'll probably forget this later so I should put a comment here saying that we should put some screenshots from manager once the UI is ready because why not
